# Team Project 2 - Pet Adoption
Made by Keshia-Lee Martin, Saurabh Patel and Bojan Golic

## Project Details
For our project, we created a page called Pets Adoption. On this page, the user is able to Sign Up or Sign In to view the Pet Dashboard which lists multiple animals. The user is able to put an animal up for adoption to find it a new home. 

Future implementations for this page would be to add a map for the locations of the animals, to have the user, if interested in adopting a pet from the dashboard, to click a button to show interest. Another implementation would be to have a survey that will help the user select the perfect pet!

Technnologies used: Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, MySQL, Sequelize, Heroku Deploy, Bootstrap, To-Constant-Case npm
